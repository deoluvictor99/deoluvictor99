Hi thereðŸ‘‹ I am a Front-End web Developer
I'm passionate about building performant and user-friendly and visually appealing user interfaces with a focus on modern frameworks. I'm proficient in Next.js for building server-rendered and static web applications, and I love using Tailwind CSS to rapidly create responsive and stylish UIs. I recently built a personal portfolio using these technologies https://deoluportflio.vercel.app/ . I'm always learning new things and excited to collaborate on projects
